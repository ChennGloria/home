		<h3>Foil</h3>
		<p>Foil is what people typically consider the “base” discipline of fencing. 
		If you understand how to fence foil, you’ll be able to quickly adapt to any other discipline
		of fencing. This is because foil balances between epee and sabre, combining both aggressive attacks
		and defensive actions into one. In comparison to the other two disciplines, foil has the most 
		versatility and difference of fencing style.

		<!--paragraph talking about the history/origin of foil-->
		<h3>Origins of the Foil</h3>
		<p class = "border">In the middle of the 18th century, the foil sword was invented as a way to practice fast 
		and elegant thrust fencing. To protect themselves from the sharp point of the sword, fencers
		would wrap a foil around the blade, or fasten a knob on the tip. However,
		this protection was often forgone in favour of duels, which— as it was done to preserve honour—
		required sharp blades.
		</p>
		
		<!--paragraph talking about the transition from a lethal art to a sport-->
		<h3>From Lethal to Lovely</h3>
		<p class = "border">Since the beginning, fencing has always had a sports component to it. However,
		it only truly began to shift from military training to an actual sport during the mid-18th century after
		<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domenico_Angelo">Domenico Angelo</a>, an Italian sword and fencing master,
		established a fencing academy. Instead of emphasizing the killing art of fencing, Angelo spoke of 
		the health and sporting benefits of fencing, helping it develop into a sport.

		<!--paragraph talking about the old udging method of competitions-->
		<h3>Scoring a Point... or Not</h3>
		<p class = "border">When fencing first began as a sport, the ways of determining when a touch had been
		made was extremely difficult. Two side judges would stand behind and beside each fencer,
		watching for any hits. Several metres away, a director would call "Halt" after each action
		and then poll the judges. If the judges differed from the Director's opinion, the Director
		had the power to completely overrule their vote. It was a method that had extreme limitations
		and problems with bias, and often, well-known fencers would be given points mistakenly. 
		</p>
		
		<!--paragraph talking about changing to electricity-->
		<h3>Swords and Electricity</h3>
		<p class = "border">On June 25, 1896, London newspaper <i>the Daily Telegraph & Courier</i> announced
		something that would change the world of fencing forever. Touches could now be recorded electronically
		instead of by the human eye, which was a huge development for both competitors and judges. As described by 
		<i>the Daily Telegraph & Courier</i>, "Briefly, the invention consists of an automatic electric recorder. 
		The instrument is fastened to the wall and connected with the collar of the combatant, from whence the 
		current is conveyed down the sleeve into the handle of the foil. The blade of the foil pressing into the 
		handle completes the connection; the current is conveyed to a bell in the instrument, and thus each hit is
		recorded." <i>(Daily Courier. Thim, 1896 reissued 1968. p. 537)</i>
