		<!--the origin of my fencing career-->
		<h3>The Beginning</h3>
		<p>I've been fencing for a long time. I started when I was seven, after my dad made a 
		wrong turn and we ended up at a suspiciously deserted plaza. My mom, who eventually grew
		tired of watching my dad struggle unfruitfully with the GPS, decided to get out of the car 
		and take a walk around. A few minutes later, she came rushing back and exclaimed, "There's
		a fencing club!" I, being young and clueless, didn't know or care about what she meant and 
		wanted to stay inside the car. (She made me get out. The rest is history...)
		</p>
		
		<!--paragraph talking about my competitions-->
		<h3>Competitions</h3>
		<p>Regardless of what you're doing, competitions are always pretty nerve-wracking. My
		first competition was a couple years ago and took place at Vango Fencing Center: coincidentally,
		my present fencing club. I remember being really excited because I got bronze, which meant I had 
		a medal just like the big kids. Now, as a big kid myself, I've gotten a little more used to fencing
		competitions and how they work. However, there's always an aspect of excitement and pure adrenaline 
		that catches me off-guard and keeps me hooked: it's the feeling of all your stress building to a
		single, boiling point as you and your opponent fence for the very last point at 14-14, exploding into
		either crushing disappointment or pure joy.

		<!--paragraph summarising final thoughts-->
		<h3 class = "big-space">Final Thoughts</h3>
		<p>I think fencing is genuinely one of the best things that has ever happened to me.
		It's not just a fun sportâ€” I've made so many life-long friends and had so many amazing
		experiences through fencing. If you ever get a chance to try it, give it a shot! You
		definitely won't regret it.
