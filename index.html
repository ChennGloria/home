		<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Welcome to fencing! If you’re looking to get started or just want to learn something new,
			this website is perfect for you. We’ll be covering the different disciplines of fencing,
			a basic overview of the rules, the history of fencing, and some insight on my own, personal experience
			with fencing! Before we get started, though, we first need to know...

		<!--brief overview of what fencing is-->
		<h2>What is Fencing?</h2>
			<p>Fencing is sword fighting.  There are three disciplines of fencing: foil, epee, and sabre. Each differs in their rules, fencing styles, and equipment, but the essence of fencing is the same: touch your opponent’s target areas for points, and gain the set amount of points to win.</p>

		<!--explaining the concept of "priority"-->
		<h3 class = "big-space">Priority</h3>
		<p>In sabre and foil fencing, when two fencers simultaneously touch a target area, 
		we use priority to determine who gets the point. The fencer who has priority will 
		receive the point over the fencer who does not have priority. In the next few 
		paragraphs, we’ll go over the two main methods of gaining priority: attacking and 
		parrying, as well as another way of gaining points without priority.

		<p class = "right border smallfont"><b>Attacking</b> is an offensive action intended 
		to either hit the opponent, or provoke a defensive reaction. For your action to be 
		considered an attack, your sword point must continuously be threatening your opponet’s
		target area. If you miss, step back during your preparation, or your hit is parried, 
		priority is lost and transferred to the other fencer.
		</p>		
		
		<!--displays Iframes on left; description of parrying on the right-->
		<p class = "right border smallfont"><b>Parrying</b> is a defensive action intended to deflect the opponent’s attack. To parry, a fencer must strike their opponent’s blade with the upper part of their own blade. By doing so, the fencer gains priority over the opponent. They can now choose to riposte, which is an immediate attack back against the opponent, or do a slower and more drawn-out attack.</p>

		<!--displays Iframes on left; description of counter-attacking on the right-->		
		<p class = "right border smallfont"><b>Counter-attacking</b> is an offensive action made
		during an opponent’s attack. It’s done when the opponent isn’t prepared to hit, is at the 
		Right Distance™, or is going at a speed that makes it difficult to aim properly. These 
		meticulous requirements are in place because you don’t have priority when you counter-attack,
		so if you and your opponent hit each other simultaneously, the point will always go to them. 
		As such, it’s important to know the right moment and timing for a counter-attack.
